# 🖼️ AI Image Generation with Stable Diffusion

This project demonstrates how to generate **AI-based images** using the **Stable Diffusion** model.  
It uses the Hugging Face **diffusers** library along with **PyTorch** for running the model locally.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Generate high-quality images from text prompts.
- Use **Stable Diffusion v1.5** model (`runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`).
- GPU support for faster image generation.
- Save and display generated images directly from the notebook.
